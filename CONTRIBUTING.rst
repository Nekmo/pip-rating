Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``pip-rating`` for local development.

#. Fork the ``pip-rating`` repo on GitHub.
#. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pip-rating.git

#. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv pip-rating
    $ cd pip-rating/
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

#. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 pip_rating tests
    $ python -m unittest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

#. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

#. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

#. The pull request should include tests.
#. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, update the docs
   directory and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
#. The code must follow the PEP8 style guide, be clean, easy to read, elegant
   and be consistent with the rest of the code in the repository.
#. The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and for PyPy. Check
   https://github.com/Nekmo/pip-rating/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m unittest tests.test_pip_rating
